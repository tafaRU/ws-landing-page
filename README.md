# Landing page in HTML & CSS

During the workshop we will **create a landing page in HTML and CSS from scratch**.

The page will be **responsive and developed mobile-first** (start for smartphone and then adapt to desktop).
We will use **no CSS frameworks** such as Bootstrap; nothing against frameworks for themselves, but we are persuaded that before taking the easy way you should know how things work for real. Then, once you know how things work you can make your choices.

**If you have never tried coding before, it's OK, we'll start from scratch**. If you can, we recommend you to **get into [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) and practice some HTML&CSS** before coming. This is not compulsory, but will help you in understanding better what we'll be doing together and making our time together more effective. If you can, dedicate some hours to FreeCodeCamp.

## Slides

You can [download the slides](https://github.com/turnintocoders/ws-landing-page/blob/master/presentation.pdf) that we use in this workshop.

## Examples

We have developed two landing page examples, that you can check:

- [Present a mobile app](http://turnintocoders.github.io/ws-landing-page/landing_app), with links to the stores
- [Present YouTube video of a music band](http://turnintocoders.github.io/ws-landing-page/landing_form), with a subscribe form
- [Book a room](http://turnintocoders.github.io/ws-landing-page/landing_snow), in a cabin in the middle of a snowy forest

## Suggested projects

You can make your own landing page, or if you need a couple of ideas for you to practice, pick one of the following:

 - Google (but responsive)
 - Sell via PayPal one thing
 - Launch an event, with form to subscribe
 - Download a nice PDF
 - Launching soon a website, leave email for updates
 - New recipe with nice pictures
 - Form with video background
